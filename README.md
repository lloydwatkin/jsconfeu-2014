## Submission

  First I was afraid, I was petrified
  Kept thinking I could never live without realtime interaction client-side.
  But then I spent so many nights thinking how XML did me wrong.
  And I grew strong, and JSON helped me get along
  And so you’re back with no name-space
  I just walked in to find no silos here ‘cause its all de-cen-tral-ized
  I shouldn’t used that custom format
  XMPP and JSON is the key
  If I’d known for just one second interoperability wouldn’t bother me
